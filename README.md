# Eslint Config

An ESLint [Shareable Config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) based on the JavaScript Standard Style [configuration](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard). The plugin dependencies on, import, node, promises, and standard were removed. No plugins are required.
